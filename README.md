LiteratureGenerator
===================

A program to generate sensible sounding text based on famous works of literature. Inspired by Part I of Shannon's seminal work "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", this program models language as a Markov process by selecting the next word based on its probability of appearance given previous words.
