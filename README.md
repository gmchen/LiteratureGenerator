LiteratureGenerator
===================

A program to generate sensible sounding text based on famous works of literature (e.g. the Complete Works of William Shakespeare). Inspired by Part I of Claude Shannon's seminal work on Information Theory, this program models language as a Markov process by selecting the next word based on its probability of appearance given previous words.
